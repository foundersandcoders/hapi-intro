## hapi.js - introductory code-along

_Before we start, please clone this repo. It contains the `public` folder with some example files (`html`,`css`,`js`) which we will practice serving using hapi. If you prefer you can create your own `public` folder with arbitrary files._

The code-along will be based largely on [this hapi tutorial](https://hapijs.com/tutorials/getting-started?lang=en_US).

We will cover the following:
1. Setting up a new project
2. Creating a server
3. Adding a 'Hello, world' route
4. Adding a route that renders user-provided data
5. Serving a static page with `inert`
6. Serving multiple public files
7. Breaking the code up into modules
